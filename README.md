The project was made within the practical framework of my high school, class 11.

I designed a 3D unit in Solid Edge. Built the unit from wood and programmed the microcontroller to display weather info.

The spice stand was milled using a
CNC mill and a plunge router. I had many small issues, which were difficult to notice, with
programming the weather station. Eliminating those software bugs turned out to be tricky.

I learned to create user interfaces with Nextion Editor, retrieve data in JSON format and how to
use a CAD (computer-aided design) program Solid Edge to make a 3D model.
